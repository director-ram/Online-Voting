- **Cost**: $0 - Completely FREE forever!
- **Setup Time**: ~20 minutes

---

## üìã STEP 1: Deploy Backend to Render

### Create Render Account
1. Go to https://render.com/register
2. Sign up with email (no credit card needed)
3. Verify your email

### Deploy Backend via Dashboard

1. **Login to Render Dashboard**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Create PostgreSQL Database**
   - Click "New +" button
   - Select "PostgreSQL"
   - Fill in:
     - Name: `voting-db`
     - Database: `voting_system`
     - User: `voting_user`
     - Region: Choose closest to you
   - Click "Create Database"
   - **Wait 2-3 minutes** for database to be ready

3. **Get Database URL**
   - Click on your database
   - Find "Internal Database URL" 
   - Copy it (save for later)

4. **Create Web Service**
   - Click "New +" button
   - Select "Web Service"
   - Choose "Build and deploy from a Git repository"
   - Click "Next"

5. **Connect Repository** (We'll use manual upload)
   - Since no Git, we'll use Blueprint instead:
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
   - OR continue with Web Service and upload manually

### Alternative: Manual Upload (Easier without Git)

1. **Create Web Service**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Select "Deploy an existing image from a registry"
   - OR use "Public Git repository"

2. **For Manual Deploy (Recommended)**
   Since you don't have Git, we'll use Render CLI:

---

## üì¶ STEP 2: Prepare for Deployment

### Install Render CLI

```powershell
# Install via npm
npm install -g render-cli

# OR download from:
# https://render.com/docs/cli
```

### Login to Render

```powershell
render login
```
Browser will open, authorize the CLI.

### Deploy Backend

```powershell
cd C:\Users\khema\Desktop\MINI-porj_jagadeesh\online-voting-system\backend

# Create render.yaml in project root (already created!)
# Deploy using:
render deploy
```

---

## üîß STEP 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Web Service ‚Üí Environment:

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
DEBUG=False
PORT=10000
DATABASE_URL=<your-postgres-internal-url>
SECRET_KEY=<generate-random-32-chars>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generate-random-32-chars>
CORS_ORIGINS=*
UPLOAD_FOLDER=uploads/profiles
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=16777216
```

**Generate Secret Keys:**
```powershell
# In PowerShell:
-join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 32 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
```
Run twice to get two different keys.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 4: Initialize Database

### Connect to Database

Use Render's built-in SQL editor:
1. Go to your PostgreSQL database in Render
2. Click "Connect" ‚Üí "External Connection"
3. Use any PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin, TablePlus, etc.)

OR use Render's query console:
1. Click on database
2. Go to "Query" tab

### Run Schema

Copy contents from: `database/voting_system.sql`
Paste and execute in query console.

### Create Admin User

After schema is loaded, run:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role, created_at)
VALUES (
  'Admin',
  'admin@voting.com',
  'scrypt:32768:8:1$xyz...', -- You'll need to hash this
  'admin',
  NOW()
);
```

**OR** use the backend script (after deployment):
```powershell
# This requires backend to be running
# We'll do this after deployment is complete
```

---

## üé® STEP 5: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

### Update API URL

1. Open: `frontend/src/config/api.js`
2. Change:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app.onrender.com';
```
(Replace with your actual Render backend URL)

### Build Frontend

```powershell
cd C:\Users\khema\Desktop\MINI-porj_jagadeesh\online-voting-system\frontend
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the `frontend/dist` folder onto the page
3. Wait for upload (~30 seconds)
4. You'll get a URL like: `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`

### Update CORS

Go back to Render Dashboard:
- Your web service ‚Üí Environment
- Update `CORS_ORIGINS` to your Netlify URL:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-app.netlify.app
```
- Service will auto-redeploy

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 6: Test Deployment

### Test Backend
```
https://your-app.onrender.com/api/candidates
```
Should return: `[]` (empty array)

### Test Frontend
1. Open your Netlify URL
2. You should see the login page
3. Try admin login:
   - Email: admin@voting.com
   - Password: admin123
