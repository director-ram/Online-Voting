```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
```
To:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app';
```
(Replace with YOUR Railway URL from Step 9)

### Step 2: Rebuild Frontend
```powershell
cd C:\Users\khema\Desktop\MINI-porj_jagadeesh\online-voting-system\frontend

### Step 5: Update CORS in Railway
1. Go back to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your **backend service**
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Find **CORS_ORIGINS** variable
5. Change from `*` to your Netlify URL:
```
https://your-voting-system.netlify.app
```
6. Backend will auto-redeploy (~1 minute)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"502 Bad Gateway"**
- Check Railway logs: Click service ‚Üí "Deployments" ‚Üí Latest deployment ‚Üí "View Logs"
- Common fix: Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly

**"CORS Error"**
- Update CORS_ORIGINS in Railway to match your Netlify URL exactly
- Make sure there's no trailing slash

**"Database connection failed"**
- Verify DATABASE_URL variable: `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
- Make sure PostgreSQL service is running

### Frontend Issues

**"Network Error" when logging in**
- Check API_BASE_URL in `frontend/src/config/api.js`
- Make sure it matches your Railway URL exactly
- Rebuild frontend after changing

**White screen / blank page**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for errors
- Common fix: Clear browser cache

**"Failed to fetch"**
- Check Railway backend is running
- Test backend URL directly in browser
